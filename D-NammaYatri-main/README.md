# Decentralized Namma Yatri
Decentralized Namma Yatri is a **decentralized auto booking application** that directly connects auto drivers to users **without any middleman**.
It is a web-based solution that enables users to book autos from their desktop or mobile browser, eliminating the need for a dedicated mobile application. The application is built on Ethereum, Solidity, EtherJS and Sanity.io for the backend, and NextJS for the frontend. Mapbox is used for showing maps in the application.

## Chatbot


A WhatsApp chatbot that books autos is an automated system that enables users to book autos through the WhatsApp messaging app. The chatbot is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology and uses Landbot as the backend.

With this chatbot, users can simply send a message to a WhatsApp number to book an auto. The chatbot will then respond to the user's message using NLP to understand their request and respond accordingly. For example, if the user sends a message requesting a ride, the chatbot will respond by asking for their pickup location and destination.

Landbot is used as the backend for the chatbot to manage the conversation flow and process the user's responses. It enables the chatbot to ask questions, gather information, and provide responses to the user based on their inputs.

Overall, this WhatsApp chatbot provides an efficient and user-friendly way to book autos, as users can book their rides through a familiar messaging app without the need for a separate booking platform.




## Tech Stack
The application is built on the following tech stack:

* Ethereum - A blockchain-based decentralized platform for building decentralized applications.
* Solidity - A contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.
* EtherJS - A collection of libraries that allow interacting with Ethereum nodes using JavaScript.
* NextJS - A popular React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
* Mapbox - A popular location data platform for building maps and location-based applications.
* Sanity.io - It is used to manage and store data related to auto drivers, users, bookings, and payments.
